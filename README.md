## How to build and deploy your app

1. Authenticate to your repo

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker <region_name>-docker.pkg.dev
```

2. Create a docker image

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

3. Testing the docker image locally

```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<port_specified_in_app> run <image_name>
```

Now you can visit http://localhost<host_port> to see the app running.

4. Tag the docker image

```bash
docker tag <image_name> <region_name>-docker.pkg.dev/<project_id>/<repository_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

5. Push the docker image to the Google Artifact Registry

```bash
docker push <region_name>-docker.pkg.dev/<project_id>/<repository_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

6. Deploy the image to the Google App Engine

```bash
gcloud app deploy --image-url=<region_name>-docker.pkg.dev/<project_id>/<repository_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

7. Browse your app

```bash
gcloud app browse
```
